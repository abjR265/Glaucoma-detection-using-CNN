# Glaucoma-detection-using-CNN
Glaucoma is a common ocular condition caused by damage to the opticqnerve, which transmits information from the eye to the 
brain. Caused by a rise in intraocular pressure, this condition is typically the result of fluid accumulating at the corneal front. Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using DenseNet-121 as well as ResNet-50, which excels in target detection owing to its core in deep learning. DenseNet, a specific kind of CNN, was crucial for accomplishing our goals; it achieved this by directly connecting all of the layers within dense blocks. Each subsequent layer feeds off the inputs of the layers above it, giving the entire network a feed-forward structure. A comparison is laid out for DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, keeping the same hyperparameters in both CNN models. Their performance is further evaluated using the ReLU activation function to demonstrate the regions predicting the two classes. For glaucoma detection, DenseNet-121 performed better than ResNet-50, showing a higher accuracy percentage.
