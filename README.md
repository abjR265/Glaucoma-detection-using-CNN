# Glaucoma-detection-using-CNN
Glaucoma is a common ocular condition caused by damage to the opticqnerve, which transmits information from the eye to the 
brain. Caused by a rise in intraocular pressure, this condition is typically the result of fluid accumulating at the corneal front. Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using DenseNet-121 as well as ResNet-50, which excels in target detection owing to its core in deep learning. DenseNet, a specific kind of CNN, was crucial for accomplishing our goals; it achieved this by directly connecting all of the layers within dense blocks. Each subsequent layer feeds off the inputs of the layers above it, giving the entire network a feed-forward structure. A comparison is laid out for DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, keeping the same hyperparameters in both CNN models. Their performance is further evaluated using the ReLU activation function to demonstrate the regions predicting the two classes.The DenseNet121 model achieved an average F-measure of 85% and accuracy of 74%, whereas the ResNet-50 model achieved an average F-measure of 83% and accuracy of 72% in distinguishing glaucoma-positive from healthy eyes. We conducted many tests with diverse numbers of epochs, batch sizes, and learning rates to identify the optimum conditions for each model. The finest outcomes were achieved with parameters like batch size of eight, number of epochs of 25, and learning rate of 0.00001. The DenseNet model, which we trained and evaluated using spatial information, excelled the ResNet model with respect to accuracy
